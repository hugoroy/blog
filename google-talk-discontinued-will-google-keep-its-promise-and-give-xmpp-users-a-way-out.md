Will Google keep its promise and give xmpp users a way out?
=======================

As you may have seen, Google announced at their Google I/O conference
that they were discontinuing their XMPP service, Google Talk. It's very
unfortunate, because XMPP is the most deployed open standard for instant
messaging. It gave Google users the ability to communicate instantly
with anyone using an XMPP federated service (like [FSFE's fellows XMPP
server](https://wiki.fsfe.org/XMPP)). [Even
Microsoft](http://windowspbx.blogspot.fr/2013/05/hangouts-wont-hangout-with-other.html)
recently enabled its users to communicate to the outside world through
XMPP. Now, Google is “replacing” Google Talk with Google+ Hangouts which
will [no longer support
XMPP](https://developers.google.com/talk/)[¹](#fn-google-talk-discontinued):

> Note: We announced a new communications product, Hangouts, in May
> 2013. Hangouts will replace Google Talk and does not support XMPP.

What we know is that Google stops XMPP federation. Soon, Google users
won't be able to chat with anybody but other Google users. If I were
paranoid, I'd say this makes their recent move on Google Talk [look
suspicious](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/google-backslides-on-federated-instant-messaging-on-purpose).
But enough whining. What can we do about this? Well, there might be a
way out for those of you who were using Google Talk as their XMPP
service and who had a lot of non-Google contacts. Did you read Google's
Terms of Service? I bet [you didn't ;-).](http://tosdr.org/#google) No
worries, we sum it up for you at [Terms of Service; Didn't
Read](http://tosdr.org/#google). So, you might have noticed this
interesting bit:

> Google enables you to get your information out when a service is
> discontinued
> [Discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/PD5ZWzgv2RI/discussion)
> Google gives you reasonable advance notice when a service is
> discontinued and “a chance to get information out of that Service.”

The full terms state:

> We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such
> data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably
> possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to
> get information out of that Service.

So far, the only notice I have seen is on a [developer
page](https://developers.google.com/talk/) so I don't think that counts
for a “reasonable advance notice”; we yet have to wait for this when
Google announces to their users that they discontinue Google Talk. Or
maybe Google's going to argue that they don't “discontinue” a Service
because Talk is replaced by Hangouts (which does not support XMPP and
which isn't federated). I'd argue it's not true and that XMPP chat is
discontinued. Hence Google should give users a way out. Let's hope that
those who have decided to [pay allegiance to
Google](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/feudal_sec.html)
will be able to get their chat contact list out of Google Talk, with a
way to import them into [XMPP providers](http://xmpp.net) which are
federated.

1.  it remains unclear whether XMPP support is entirely gone for
    xmpp-client-to-server according to
    [Ars](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/hands-on-with-hangouts-googles-new-text-and-video-chat-architecture/)[↩](#ref-xmpp-support)
