<p>[This post is part of a series in collaboration with the BBC Radio 4 “Law in Action,” where we try to debunked some of the myths related to terms of service and privacy policies. <a href="http://tosdr.org/blog/tosdr-in-action-i-have-read-and-agree.html">Read episode 1</a>]</p>
<p>This week, we're focusing on another big matter when it comes to terms of service. This one takes many forms and raises questions (“can they sell my content?”), that some Terms try to deal with by writing things like: “What is yours stays yours” or “You retain your rights to your photos”, etc.</p>
<p>However, most of these statements are meaningless. Because copyright law doesn't work that way; there are many things you can do with a copyright which are not “selling” in a legal sense.</p>
<h2 id="a-very-basic-introduction-to-copyright-and-authors-rights">A (very) basic introduction to copyright and author's rights</h2>
<p>The basic principle is that once a person has created or invested in a work, usually with a minimum of creativity, this person is automatically considered the “author” or the copyright holder of that work. (There are differences around the world, but we can say it's a basic principle under the Berne convention that treats copyright and author's rights).</p>
<p>The aim of such laws has various justifications: allowing to reward creators for their work and incentivise their production; organising exclusive rights to enable return-on-investments; enhancing creativity to bring benefits to society at large; etc.</p>
<p>If nowadays, copyright has been discussed at great lengths in the media and in politics as a burning issue as for non-authorised distribution of music and films on the Internet, another significant side of copyright has been mainly overlooked.</p>
<h2 id="how-services-exploit-your-copyright">How services exploit your copyright</h2>
<p>Today, incredibly vast amounts of copyrighted works are published by users on the Web (in the so-called Web 2.0 era of “User Generated Content”), through publication services such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc. However, very little has been said about what happens to users' copyrights. The sad truth is, a lot of services are claiming over-broad rights on users' content; content which creation they had no involvement with whatsoever.</p>
<ul>
<li>True, with these services “you retain your rights” to your content. They do not ask for a transfer of copyright ownership, but they mainly ask you to grant them broad, sometimes almost-unlimited licenses to your content.</li>
<li>True, these services do not “sell” your content. What they do is they <em>transfer</em> the license you grant them, or the grant <em>sublicenses</em> themselves to third-parties.</li>
<li>True, users have “agreed” to that. But we know that the current agreement to terms of service is <a href="http://tosdr.org/blog/tosdr-in-action-i-have-read-and-agree.html">meaningless</a> and that moreover for many services (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Twitpic, etc.) the current copyright license was made in changes to the terms.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://tosdr.org/#twitter">Twitter</a> can change the terms at any time when they see fit. They give notification, in their sole discretion, via an @Twitter update or via email. In September 2009, Twitter considerably changed the terms for the copyright license and only gave a very short notice, only a few hours before the changes applied. Moreover, if you actually try to go read that email, and then the blog post it links to, you will notice that Twitter omits to mention the biggest changes to their copyright license. [See our discussion: <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/-B4iO-9xHvg/0yoWGoEISrEJ">on the mailing-list</a>]</p>
<p><a href="http://tosdr.org/#twitpic">Twitpic</a> has been able to exploit the rights users have granted them, most probably without knowing. For instance, when Twitpic realised they could make money off their users' pictures, they <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13372982">changed the copyright license</a> to make a deal with media agency WENN.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://tosdr.org/#instagram">Instagram</a> was bought by Facebook, they only had a limited copyright license that was neither transferable, nor sublicensable. At this stage, although Facebook had bought the company Instagram for $1 billion, Facebook could not really benefit from the rights over users' photos. Guess what, when Instagram changed their terms in January this year, they aligned their copyright license to Facebook's (among <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/12/19/instagram_privacy_everyone_s_ignoring_the_real_problems_with_its_terms_of.html">other issues</a>).</p>
<p>Before January 19, 2013:</p>

<p>Rights</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service.

<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>

<p>(Do not hesitate to have a look back at Facebook's <a href="http://consumerist.com/2009/02/15/facebooks-new-terms-of-service-we-can-do-anything-we-want-with-your-content-forever/">previous copyright licenses</a>)</p>
<h2 id="but-this-is-necessary-for-them-right">But, this is necessary for them, right?</h2>
<p>I have seen some arguments, stating that these copyright licenses are “boilerplate” (implying they're everywhere) and that they're really necessary for them to provide you with the service.</p>
<p>But this is far from true. First, these copyright terms are far from boilerplate. Indeed, even between similar services, there are huge differences. As you can see here, there is a wide vaeriety of copyright licenses that we have <a href="http://tosdr.org/topics.html#copyright-scope">mapped</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, the copyright license you grant to <a href="http://tosdr.org/#youtube">YouTube</a> bears no explicit limitation, whereas <a href="http://tosdr.org/#vimeo">Vimeo's</a> copyright license is explicitly limited to 4 purposes. Moreover, the copyright license you grant to Vimeo is neither transferable nor sublicensable, as opposed to YouTube.</p>
<p>To take another example, you can compare the copyright license that [Twitter][] requires with the license for <a href="http://tosdr.org/#identi-ca">Identi.ca</a> or <a href="http://tosdr.org/#seenthis">SeenThis</a>. In case this isn't significant enough, you can also compare Twitter's current copyright license, with the copyright license they had <a href="https://twitter.com/tos/previous">before 2009</a>.</p>
<p>If it were really necessary for these services to get such broad copyright licenses, I still see no clear reason why they would ask for the possibility to <em>transfer</em> or to <em>sublicense</em> them. On the other hand, if it is a matter of necessity, then services could just state it clearly in the copyright licenses themselves. For instance, <a href="http://tosdr.org/#soundcloud">SoundCloud</a> asks for copyright license like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To the extent it is necessary</strong> in order for SoundCloud to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licences to SoundCloud on a <strong>limited</strong>, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis. <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/_gI8wQ3PZ2M/discussion">Source</a></p>
